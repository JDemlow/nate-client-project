              Hi, I’m Lexi. I founded Aidly to give nonprofits and small
              businesses a new option for their IT consulting needs. Years in
              the nonprofit industry have taught me that it can be difficult to
              find consultants who take a value-driven, relationship-centered
              approach to their work. That’s where Aidly comes in. We care about
              your employees, your mission, and your values, which is why we
              want to help you leverage technology more effectively. ​ I hope I
              get the opportunity to learn more about you and your organization.
              In the meantime, here is some important information about me:

          We believe that how we work is just as important as what we do. Our
          work is centered around our core values of equity, community, and
          transparency.
        </p>
        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Equity</h3>

            We believe that honoring individuals' unique needs helps advance
            social justice...
          </p>
          <ul class="value-bullets">
            <li>
              We meet people where they are by tailoring our services and prices
              to each client’s goals, financial status, and access to other
              resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              We try to acknowledge and value the diversity of our clients’
              organizations in all the work we do.
            </li>
            <li>
              We center voices from marginalized communities in our work to

              We donate at least 5% of our revenues up to $300K and 25% of our
              revenues over $300K to grassroots and mutual aid groups who
              struggle to access traditional funding.

            <li>
              We send our clients quarterly donation reports so they can see how

                and implement solutions significantly enhanced our operational
                efficiency. Lexi has a deep understanding of technology as well

                operate with a small team and having Aidly as a partner has been
                like having another member of the team we can rely on. Over the
                course of the last year we have worked with Aidly to build two
                websites, rebrand our company, update and migrate email and file
                systems, develop and implement surveys and data collection
                processes, and manage our day to day IT environment. Lexi and
                her team are responsive, knowledgeable, creative, and excellent
                problem solvers. Lexi excels at training staff in an accessible
                and responsive way while also providing clear documentation for
                systems and processes. Aidly has helped us think through the
                best ways to set up our systems and accomplish our goals while
                centering our shared values. We highly recommend them to anyone
                needing fractional IT or CIO support."

                Lexi from Aidly, a standout professional whose technical
                expertise is matched only by her kindness and dedication to
                client satisfaction. From the onset, Lexi distinguished herself
                from the crowd of IT services with a genuine and approachable
                demeanor. Her kindness and patience was immediately evident,
                creating an environment where questions were not only welcomed
                but encouraged. In an industry often characterized by technical
                jargon, Lexi effortlessly translated complex concepts, ensuring
                that even those less familiar with IT could grasp the
                information. Beyond their technical prowess, Lexi consistently
                went the extra mile to understand our specific needs and
                challenges. Her ability to empathize with our team members who
                may not be as tech-savvy fostered a positive and inclusive
                atmosphere. Lexi is always willing to take the time to explain
                solutions in a way that makes everyone feel comfortable and
                supported.
