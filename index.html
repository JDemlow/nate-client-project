              Hi, I’m Lexi. I founded Aidly to give nonprofits and small
              businesses a new option for their IT consulting needs. Years in
              the nonprofit industry have taught me that it can be difficult to
              find consultants who take a value-driven, relationship-centered
              approach to their work. That’s where Aidly comes in. We care about
              your employees, your mission, and your values, which is why we
              want to help you leverage technology more effectively. ​ I hope I
              get the opportunity to learn more about you and your organization.
              In the meantime, here is some important information about me:

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that how we work is just as important as what we do. Our
          work is centered around our core values of equity, community, and
          transparency.
        </p>
        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Equity</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that honoring individuals' unique needs helps advance
            social justice...
          </p>
          <ul class="value-bullets">
            <li>
              We meet people where they are by tailoring our services and prices
              to each client’s goals, financial status, and access to other
              resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              We try to acknowledge and value the diversity of our clients’
              organizations in all the work we do.
            </li>
            <li>
              We center voices from marginalized communities in our work to
              learn how to be more equitable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Community</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that our community helps us succeed, so we should give
            back to it in return...
          </p>
          <ul class="value-bullets">
            <li>
              We cater our services to nonprofits and small businesses that
              share our emphasis on community.
            </li>
            <li>
              We donate at least 5% of our revenues up to $300K and 25% of our
              revenues over $300K to grassroots and mutual aid groups who
              struggle to access traditional funding.
            </li>
            <li>
              We volunteer in our community for at least two hours each week.

        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that equal and open access to information disrupts unfair
            power dynamics...
          </p>
          <ul class="value-bullets">
            <li>
              We give clients a complete upfront cost before they pay us
              anything.
            </li>
            <li>
              We send our clients quarterly donation reports so they can see how
              much and which organizations we donate to.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will coordinate translation and interpretation services if you
              have employees who communicate in languages other than English.
